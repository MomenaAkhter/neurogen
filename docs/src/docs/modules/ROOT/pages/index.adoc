= NeuroGen

NeuroGen is an open-source, extensible, and modular evolution simulator primarily built for self-driving cars. It's based on Unity and written with C#.

It supports persistent storage of genomes using database libraries like https://www.sqlite.org/index.html[SQLite 3]. The database layer is written in C/C++ as a library, which is imported into the Unity project as a https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/NativePlugins.html[native plugin].

Entire source code is hosted on GitHub in this https://github.com/MomenaAkhter/neurogen[repository].

== Built-in Extensions:

* xref:extensions:neat_pack.adoc[NEATPack]
* xref:extensions:unity_neat.adoc[UnityNEAT]

== Credits

* https://github.com/MomenaAkhter[Momena Akhter Shukhi] for development. 

// == Features

// * Simulate evolution of custom entities
// * Define custom environment for simulation
// * Save progress of evolution after every generation
// * Control vital variables of evolution
// ** Mutation rate
// ** Speed
// ** Population size
// * Web Portal
// ** Track sessions
// ** Track generations
// ** View scores at every saved state

// == Notes

// * *SimpleExperiment* connects *UnityParallelEvaluator* with *SimpleEvaluator*. It also connects the *Optimizer* with both of the evaluators.

// * *AbstractGenerationalAlgorithm* holds *AlgorithmThreadMethod*, which manages the evolution at the ground level.

// * *NeatEvolutionAlgorithm*, which inherits *AbstractGenerationalAlgorithm*, performs each generation.

// * In each generation, *UnityParallelListEvaluator* is used as genome list evaluator.

// * *UnityParallelListEvaluator* uses SimpleEvaluator as evaluator.
